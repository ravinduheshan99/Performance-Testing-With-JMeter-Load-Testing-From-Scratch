# Performance Testing With JMeter - Load Testing From Scratch

A comprehensive repository documenting my learning and practical exercises from the **Top-Class JMeter Load Testing** course. This project focuses on mastering **performance and load testing** of web applications and REST APIs using Apache JMeter, along with scripting, data-driven testing, and Selenium integration.

## 📘 Course Overview

This repository is based on a detailed **JMeter course** designed to take learners from **scratch to advanced performance testing**. The course covers all aspects of JMeter including UI components, Thread Groups, Listeners, Controllers, Assertions, Timers, Correlation, and scripting using **Beanshell**, along with Selenium integration for real-world testing scenarios.

By the end of this course, you will be able to **design robust performance test cases**, monitor application performance under load, and generate meaningful reports for analysis.
